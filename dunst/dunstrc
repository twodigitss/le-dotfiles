    #        <b>bold</b>
    #        <i>italic</i>
    #        <s>strikethrough</s>
    #        <u>underline</u>
    # strip: This setting is provided for compatibility with some broken
    #        clients that send markup even though it's not enabled on the
    #        server. Dunst will try to strip the markup but the parsing is
    #        simplistic so using this option outside of matching rules for
    #        specific applications *IS GREATLY DISCOURAGED*.
    #
    # no:    Disable markup parsing, incoming notifications will be treated as
    #        plain text. Dunst will not advertise that it has the body-markup
    #        capability if this is set as a global setting.
    #
    # It's important to note that markup inside the format option will be parsed
    # regardless of what this is set to.

    format = "<i>%s</i> \n%b" 
    # The format of the message.  Possible variables are:
    #   %a  appname

    #   %i  iconname (including its path)
    #   %I  iconname (without its path)
    #   %p  progress value if set ([  0%] to [100%]) or nothing
    #   %n  progress value if set without any extra characters
    #   %%  Literal %
    # Markup is allowed

    ignore_dbusclose = false
    # Ignore the dbus closeNotification message.
    # Useful to enforce the timeout set by dunst configuration. Without this

    # user defined timeout.

    # Set this to true to use X11 output on Wayland.
    	force_xwayland = false


# /-----/ LEGACY CONFIGURATION /-----/

    force_xinerama = false
    # Use the Xinerama extension instead of RandR for multi-monitor support.
    # This setting is provided for compatibility with older nVidia drivers that
    # do not support RandR and using it on systems that support RandR is highly
    # discouraged.
    #
    # By enabling this setting dunst will not be able to detect when a monitor
    # is connected or disconnected which might break follow mode if the screen
    # layout changes.


# /-----/ MOUSE CONFIGURATION /-----/

    # Defines list of actions for each mouse event
    # Possible values are:
    # * none: Don't do anything.
    	# * do_action: Invoke the action determined by the action_name rule. If there is no such action, open the context menu.
    		# * open_url: If the notification has exactly one url, open it. If there are multiple ones, open the context menu.

    # * close_current: Close current notification.
    	# * close_all: Close all notifications.
    		# * context: Open context menu for the notification.
    
    # * context_all: Open context menu for all notifications.
    # These values can be strung together for each mouse event, and
    # will be executed in sequence.


# /-----/ EXPERIMENTAL FEATURES CONFIGURATION /-----/

# to have a consistent behaviour across releases.
[experimental]
    # Calculate the dpi to use on a per-monitor basis.
    # If this setting is enabled the Xft.dpi value will be ignored and instead

    # using the resolution and physical size. This might be useful in setups
    # where there are multiple screens with very different dpi values.

# Every section that isn't one of the above is interpreted as a rules to
# override settings for certain messages.
#
# Messages can be matched by
#    appname (discouraged, see desktop_entry)

#    category
#    desktop_entry

#
# Instead of the appname filter, it's recommended to use the desktop_entry filter.
# GLib based applications export their desktop-entry name. In comparison to the appname,
# the desktop-entry won't get localized.
#
# SCRIPTING
# You can specify a script that gets run when the rule matches by
# setting the "script" option.
# The script will be called as follows:
#   script appname summary body icon urgency
# where urgency can be "LOW", "NORMAL" or "CRITICAL".
#
# NOTE: It might be helpful to run dunst -print in a terminal in order
# to find fitting options for rules.

# client

# fullscreen values
# show: show the notifications, regardless if there is a fullscreen window opened
# delay: displays the new notification, if there is no fullscreen window active
#        If the notification is already drawn, it won't get undrawn.
# pushback: same as delay, but when switching into fullscreen, the notification will get
#           withdrawn from screen again and will get delayed like a new notification
